                <h1>What Are OC's?</h1>
                <p class="psize">Since OC's shall be appearing around this website often, I might as well describe them. OC is short for "original character", which is a character created for some type of purpose. an OC can be a main character from a movie, or a mascot from a company. As an animator, I have created a few OC's of my own with unique stories for animating purposes (and just because I love them for who they are). One of these OC's, as seen above, is Hannah; a tired wolf in desperate need of sleep. Hannah is also used as a persona; created as some kind of replica of me or is considered my "icon" character.</p>
